# Theory of prediction

This repository contains work completed in the university course "Theory of prediction". The course is divided into two blocks: regression analysis, time series.

## Significance of factor and confidence intervals

This file implements the Fisher test and the Student t test. In addition, 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the model coefficients and confidence intervals were constructed for the prediction and for the response.

## Study of residues

Implementation of checking the adequacy of the model. The adequacy of the model is checked using:

1. checking the constancy of the mathematical expectation
   * plot of residues
   * variance analysis of errors through residuals
2. checks for consistency of variance
   * plot of residues
   * White's criterion
   * Goldfeld-Quandt test
3. checking for absence of autocorrelation
   * autocorrelation function graph
   * Ljung-Box Q test
4. checking agreement with normal distribution
   * histogram + density plot
   * probability paper
   * Pearson-Fisher chi-square-test
  
## Trend, seasonality, ACF
